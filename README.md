## Recommendations


- Follow what happened in March in terms of the increase in the number of sales.
- I provide the best-selling products in quantities like a set.
- We provide the best-selling products in quantities such as a (set( in months with sales, especially for women. Therefore, we can provide them in other months, but with different offers.
- The sales that are returned should have a tax so that they cannot be refunded.
- Best-selling products may not be subject to adelivery tax during months of special occasions.
- Since there is a demand from men on the site, we can 
- increase sales by introducing types of men's  products into the site.
- I offer deals with other companies, for example, those that specialize in cosmetics, during the months with lower sales, and if I find a demand, I put them in the months with higher sales.
- Since adult and teen categories are the most buying for sales, target them more through ads on social media sites, and if possible, run competitions to increase visibility on the sites and increase sales.
- The problem of seniors in purchasing may be due to the difficulty of dealing with the site, so we should allocate sites that are easy to use for the elderl

- The problem of employee absence during working hours is greater than those present. The solution is for me to set an example for each task in relation to this employer, and thus I will reduce absences because employees tend to be present due to this work.

- Those who leave work also return to the fact that there is no promotion or there is a minority for promotion, and thus the number of employees will decrease more and more. The solution is to have a goal at work, and whoever is higher every year will be promoted based on his goal.
